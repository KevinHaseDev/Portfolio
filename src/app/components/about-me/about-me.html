            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Kevin! I love coding because it allows me to create things from nothing, it’s like turning ideas
                into reality. Technology never stops evolving, and that keeps me curious. What inspires me most is
                seeing my code actually work and make a difference, even in small ways. Every project teaches me
                something new and pushes me to improve.</p>

                    <p>I’m currently based in Meiningen, Germany, where I live with my family and three children. While
                        relocation isn’t possible for me, I’m fully open to remote opportunities and highly value
                        teamwork
                        and collaboration across distances. I enjoy working with diverse professionals from different
                        backgrounds and believe that great results can be achieved from anywhere.</p>

                    <p>I’m an open-minded developer who’s always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill
                        set.
                        The fast-paced nature of the IT world motivates me to stay curious, keep learning, and adapt
                        quickly
                        to emerging tools and frameworks.</p>

                    <p>My approach to problem-solving combines analytical thinking, creativity, and persistence. I see
                        every
                        challenge as a learning opportunity to refine my understanding and improve my efficiency. I
                        enjoy
                        collaborating with others to find elegant and scalable solutions that not only work — but work
                        beautifully.</p>
